There are different methods to solve a linear system of equations. One of them is Cramer's rule, also called the determinant method. With the help of Cramer's rule, equation systems with any number of unknowns can be solved. Only requirement is that there has to be as many equations as unknowns.

This Android app can solve a linear system with 3 equations and 3 unknowns, using Cramer's rule.

This project has been developed in the context of the technical presentation, which is necessary for the advanced technical college entrance qualification. The project, the exposé and the presentation were rated with 15 grade points, the highest possible score.
